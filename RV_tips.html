  <p>Looking for a place to stay for free on a longer basis?  National Forests are a good choice.  Many have established campgrounds that are usually a modest price.  Facilities may be restricted to merely a pit toilet and hand pump for a water source.  Keep in mind, if you stay outside the established campground, there is no charge.  Dry camping is free and you’re welcome to set up camp and get comfortable.</p>
